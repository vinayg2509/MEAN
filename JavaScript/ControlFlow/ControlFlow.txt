                                                    Control flow and decisions statements:

Control flow is the order in which a program's statements are executed. It's how you tell a program to make decisions, repeat actions, or jump to a different part of the code based on certain conditions.

1)Simple if:

A simple if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

2)if else if

This is the most common form of conditional logic.
if: Executes a block of code if the specified condition is true.
else if: Provides an alternative condition to check if the first if condition is false. You can have multiple else if blocks.
else: Executes a block of code if all preceding if and else if conditions are false

3)switch
A switch statement is an alternative to a long if...else if chain when you have a single expression to compare against multiple possible values.


4)if-else
An if-else statement is a conditional control structure that executes a block of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false. It's a fundamental tool for making decisions in your code.

Control flow

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met.

For Loop
A for loop is used when you know exactly how many times you want to loop. It has three parts:
Initialization: A statement executed once before the loop begins.
Condition: The condition that is checked before each loop iteration. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
 Increment/Decrement: A statement executed after each iteration.
  

While Loop
A while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is best used when you don't know exactly how many times the loop will run.

Jump Statements

Jump statements allow you to transfer control to another part of the program.
break: Jumps out of a loop or switch statement, ending its execution.
continue: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next one.
