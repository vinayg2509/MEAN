---------------VARIABLES-----------------
Variables are named container used for storing data values.

VAR :
    var is a function scoped 
    var can be redeclared and reinitialized within the same block
    it is hoisted and if we try to access before initialization we get undefined

LET :
    let is a block scoped
    let cannot be re declared within the same block
    it is not hoisted and if we try to access it we get reference error or TEZ(temporal dead zone)

CONST :
    const is also a block scoped and is a constant
    values cannot be redeclared and reinitialized and must be initialized at the time  of declaration
    once the values are assigned we connot change it for primary data types
    assigned values can be modified for non-primitive datatypes
