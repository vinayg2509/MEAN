-----------------------------------Data Types---------------------------------------

JavaScript categorizes all data into two main types: primitive and non-primitive

Primitive Data Types:

Primitive data types represent single, immutable values. When you copy a primitive value, a new, independent copy is created

1.String
2.biginit
3.number
4.null
5.undefined
6.Symbol
7.boolean

1.String:
    Represents textual data. A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes ('...'), double quotes ("..."), or backticks (`...`).
    Examples:
        let name = "John";
        let message = 'Hello World!';

2.biginit:
    Represents whole numbers larger than the maximum value a number can hold (2^53âˆ’1). A bigint is created by appending n to an integer.
    Examples:
      let largeNumber = 9007199254740991n;

3.number:
    Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. 
    Examples:
      let age = 25;
      let price = 19.99;
    
4.null:
     Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's a placeholder for an empty value.
     let bike = null;

5.undefined:
    Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value. It's the default value of a variable.

6.Symbol:
     Represents a unique and immutable identifier. Symbols are often used as unique property keys for objects to avoid naming collisions.
     Examples:
     const id = Symbol('id');

7.boolean:
     Represents a logical entity and can only have two values: true or false.
     Examples:
     let isStudent = true;
     let hasLicense = false;

Non-primitive

Non-primitive data types, also known as objects, can hold multiple values and are mutable. When you copy a non-primitive value, you're copying the reference to the object, not the object itself.

object:
    An object in JavaScript is a standalone entity that holds a collection of related data and functionality.
    Example:
       let car1 = {
        color: "blue",
        make: "Ford",
        model: "Mustang",
        startEngine: function () {
        console.log("Engine started!");
      },
    };


Arrays:
    An array is a single variable used to store multiple elements, which are typically of the same data type
    
    Example:
    // Array Literal Notation (Recommended)
    const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

    // Array Constructor
    const cars = new Array("Ford", "Honda", "Toyota");
